# Hyperparameter_Tuning_Gradient_Boosting
Hyperparameter tuning experiments, using experimental design and Gaussian Process Regression to learn the optimal parameters of LightGBM and XGBoost Models part of a final project in a Graduate Level Course in Experimental Design.

Experiments performed on published data sets where I beat the authors out of sample performance with less experiments run.
